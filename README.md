# **K**ian's **H**ome**w**ork template for LaTeX
A template for completing homework assignments and taking notes in LaTeX.

This project provides the `khw` document class in LaTeX.
It requires the XeLaTeX compiler.

The project evolves whenever I need new features in the template.
Feel free to use it, but do not expect support.

## Example document
See the `example` directory for an example document.
The compiled PDF is included in the repository as `example/hottopic.pdf`.
